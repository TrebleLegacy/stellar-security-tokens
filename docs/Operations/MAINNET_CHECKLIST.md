# Radox — Mainnet Migration Checklist

> Last updated: 2026-03-31

This document details all specific actions required to transition the **Radox** platform from Testnet to Mainnet (Production).

---

## 🌍 Environment Variables Configuration

Create a production `.env` file with the following changes:

### Network Settings
| Variable | Testnet Value | **Production Value** |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| `STELLAR_NETWORK` | `testnet` | `public` |
| `STELLAR_HORIZON_URL` | `https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org` | `https://horizon.stellar.org` |
| `SOROBAN_RPC_URL` | `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org` | `https://soroban-rpc.mainnet.stellar.gateway.fm` |
| `VITE_STELLAR_NETWORK` | `testnet` | `public` |
| `VITE_SOROBAN_RPC_URL` | *(Testnet URL)* | `https://soroban-rpc.mainnet.stellar.gateway.fm` |
| `VITE_STELLAR_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE`| `Test SDF Network ; September 2015` | `Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015` |

> ⚠️ **VITE vars are baked into the bundle at `docker build` time.** Changing them in `.env.production` alone is NOT enough — you must rebuild the frontend image (`docker compose up -d --build frontend`).

### Keys & Accounts (Action Required)
> **NOTE:** The platform uses `KEY_MANAGEMENT_MODE=multisig` — only public keys + the Operations hot wallet key are needed. Issuer/Treasury/Distributor sign via Freighter/Ledger.

- [ ] **Generate new mainnet keypairs** for Issuer, Distributor, Treasury, Operations. Fund each with XLM.
- [ ] **All `*_PUBLIC_KEY` vars**: Update in `.env.production` with mainnet public keys.
- [x] **`USDC_ISSUER`**: **No action needed.** `getUsdcIssuer()` in `stellar.js` auto-detects Circle's mainnet issuer (`GA5ZS...`) when `STELLAR_NETWORK=public`. The env var is only an override for non-Circle USDC.

### Operations Hot Wallet Security
> `OPERATIONS_SECRET_KEY` is the **only** secret key on the server. It sponsors gasless transactions (wallet creation, trustlines).

- [x] **Docker Secrets** — key stored at `/root/.secrets/operations_key` (chmod 600), mounted to container at `/run/secrets/operations_key` (tmpfs, never on disk). `KeyManager.#readOperationsSecret()` reads it automatically.
- [ ] **Fresh keypair** — generate a new mainnet Operations key at deploy time. Never reuse testnet keys.
- [ ] **Minimal balance** — keep only ~50 XLM (enough for ~1000 sponsored txns). Refill as needed.
- [ ] **Account monitoring** — set `ADMIN_ALERT_EMAIL` in `.env.production` to receive automated balance alerts from `WalletMonitorService` (emails when XLM drops below `OPERATIONS_WALLET_WARNING_XLM` default 20 XLM or `OPERATIONS_WALLET_CRITICAL_XLM` default 5 XLM). Without `ADMIN_ALERT_EMAIL`, the monitor logs only — no email alerts.
- [ ] **Alert thresholds** — optionally tune `OPERATIONS_WALLET_WARNING_XLM` and `OPERATIONS_WALLET_CRITICAL_XLM` (defaults: 20 and 5 XLM).
- [ ] **External monitoring** — additionally set up alerts on [stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert) for unexpected transactions on the Operations account.
- [ ] **Key rotation plan** — document how to rotate the Operations key if compromised (replace `/root/.secrets/operations_key`, recreate backend container).

### Smart Contracts (Smart Account Kit)
> Current values in `.env.production` are **testnet**. All four must be re-deployed/looked up for mainnet.

- [ ] **`ACCOUNT_WASM_HASH`**: Deploy OZ Smart Account WASM to Mainnet and record hash. *(Testnet hash already set — must be replaced for mainnet.)*
- [ ] **`WEBAUTHN_VERIFIER_ADDRESS`**: Look up OZ's pre-deployed WebAuthn verifier address on mainnet. *(Testnet address already set.)*
- [ ] **`ED25519_VERIFIER_ADDRESS`**: Look up OZ's pre-deployed Ed25519 verifier address on mainnet. *(Testnet address already set.)*
- [ ] **`SALE_WASM_HASH`**: Deploy token_sale v6 WASM to Mainnet and record hash. *(Testnet hash already set — must be replaced for mainnet.)*
- [ ] **`SETTLEMENT_WASM_HASH`** ⚠️ NEW: Deploy MaturitySettlement WASM to Mainnet and record hash. **Critical for debt offers** — if unset, `POST /api/admin/offers/:id/deploy-settlement` returns 400 at call time (not at startup). Any debt offer that matures without this set will be stuck in `matured` state with no automated recovery path. *(No testnet default — must be set before any debt offer is approved.)*
- [ ] **`YIELD_DISTRIBUTOR_CONTRACT_ID`**: Deployed YieldDistributor contract ID on mainnet.

### Soroban Asset Contracts (SAC IDs)
> Currently set to testnet SAC IDs — must be updated for mainnet.

- [ ] **`XLM_SAC_CONTRACT_ID`**: Look up mainnet XLM SAC on [Stellar Expert](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public). Current value is testnet.
- [ ] **`USDC_SAC_CONTRACT_ID`**: Look up mainnet USDC (Circle) SAC on [Stellar Expert](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public). Current value is testnet.

### Channel Accounts Pool (Parallel Fee Sponsorship)
- [ ] **Generate 5 new keypairs** for mainnet (never reuse testnet keys):
  ```bash
  node -e "const {Keypair}=require('@stellar/stellar-sdk'); for(let i=1;i<=5;i++){const k=Keypair.random(); console.log('CHANNEL_'+i+'_SECRET_KEY='+k.secret()); console.log('# Public: '+k.publicKey()); console.log();}"
  ```
- [ ] **Fund each with 2 XLM** from the Operations wallet (enough for ~20,000 fee-bump TXs each).
- [ ] **Add secret keys** to production env (`CHANNEL_1_SECRET_KEY`..`CHANNEL_5_SECRET_KEY`).
- [ ] **Verify pool loads** — backend log should show: `Initialized channel pool with 5 accounts.`
- [ ] **File permissions** — ensure channel keys have same security as `OPERATIONS_SECRET_KEY` (chmod 600 or Docker Secrets).

### Infrastructure & Security
- [ ] **`DB_SSL`**: Keep `false` for self-hosted Docker (internal network). Only set `true` for managed cloud DB (AWS RDS, Supabase, etc.).
- [x] **`JWT_SECRET`**: Generated with `openssl rand -hex 32`. Real value present in `.env.production`.
- [x] **`WEBAUTHN_RP_ID`**: Set to `radox.net` in `.env.production`.
- [x] **`WEBAUTHN_ORIGIN`**: Set to `https://app.radox.net` in `.env.production`.
- [x] **`FRONTEND_URL`**: Set to `https://app.radox.net` in `.env.production`.
- [x] **`API_URL`**: Set to `https://api.radox.net` in `.env.production`.
- [ ] **`VITE_API_URL`**: Keep as `/api` (same-origin proxy via nginx). *(Already correct in `docker-compose.prod.yml` build arg.)*

### Third Party Services
- [x] **`RESEND_API_KEY`**: Live Resend key present in `.env.production`. *(Same key works for testnet and mainnet.)*
- [ ] **Channels API Key**: `.env.production` has a **testnet** OZ Channels key. Get **mainnet** API key from [channels.openzeppelin.com/gen](https://channels.openzeppelin.com/gen).
  > ~~Launchtube Mainnet JWT~~ — **Launchtube has been replaced by OpenZeppelin Channels.** The item below is obsolete: ~~"Launchtube Mainnet JWT: Obtain from SDF"~~.
- [ ] **Pusher credentials**: `.env.production` has `<YOUR_PUSHER_*>` placeholders. Fill in or disable real-time if not needed for MVP. Real-time notifications will silently fail with placeholder values.

### Admin Accounts
- [ ] **`ADMIN_2_EMAIL`**: Currently `admin2@stellar-tokens.local` (a dummy placeholder). Update to Gabriel's real email before mainnet launch.
  > Admins are seeded at container startup from `ADMIN_1_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_2_EMAIL` env vars (or the `bootstrap-admin.sh` script). A bad email means Gabriel's admin account won't work.

## 🏗️ Build & Deployment

### Frontend
- Run `npm run build` in the `frontend` directory (or `docker compose up --build`).
- **CRITICAL**: Set `VITE_*` env vars **before building** — they are baked into the bundle at build time, not at runtime.
  - `VITE_STELLAR_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE=Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015`
  - `VITE_SOROBAN_RPC_URL=https://soroban-rpc.mainnet.stellar.gateway.fm`

### Database
- Run `npm run migrate` (or `npx prisma migrate deploy` inside container) to apply migrations.
- Enable SSL (`DB_SSL=true`) only for managed PostgreSQL (RDS, Supabase). Not needed for Docker-internal Postgres.

### Key Generation
```bash
# JWT Secret
openssl rand -hex 32

# Stellar Keypairs (run for Issuer, Distributor, Treasury, Operations)
node -e "const {Keypair} = require('@stellar/stellar-sdk'); const kp = Keypair.random(); console.log('SECRET=' + kp.secret()); console.log('PUBLIC=' + kp.publicKey());"
```

## 🔒 Security Audit (Before Launch)

### Dependency Audit
```bash
cd backend && npm audit
cd frontend && npm audit
```

- [ ] **No critical vulnerabilities** in production dependencies
- [ ] **Review high severity issues** - ensure none are exploitable in our code paths
- [ ] **Document exceptions** for non-exploitable transitive dependencies

### Multisig Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm run multisig:inspect  # Verify account configuration
npm run multisig:setup    # Configure production signers
```

- [ ] **Treasury account** - 2-of-3 multisig with Ledger keys
- [ ] **Issuer account** - Locked after initial token setup
- [ ] **Master keys disabled** on all production accounts

### Error Monitoring
- [ ] **SENTRY_DSN** configured in backend `.env` (optional but strongly recommended for production)
- [ ] **VITE_SENTRY_DSN** configured in frontend `.env` (optional but strongly recommended)

### Stellar-Specific Security (CRITICAL)

> ⚠️ **Read the full audit:** [06_security_audit.md](../Project_Bible/06_security_audit.md)
> *(Note: `STELLAR_SECURITY_AUDIT.md` referenced here previously does not exist — the audit is in `docs/Project_Bible/06_security_audit.md`)*

- [ ] **Verify issuer flags** - Run `npm run multisig:inspect` to confirm:
  - `auth_required: true`
  - `auth_revocable: true`
  - `auth_clawback_enabled: true`

- [ ] **Set up issuer thresholds for SAC auto-authorization** ⚠️
  > Without this, every investment fails with `"balance is deauthorized"`.
  > The operations key needs to be a signer on the issuer account so it can
  > call `set_authorized()` on the SAC automatically during purchases.
  
  Go to [Stellar Laboratory](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#txbuilder?network=public) → **Set Options** on the **issuer account**:
  - Master Weight: `10`
  - Low Threshold: `1`
  - Medium Threshold: `2`
  - High Threshold: `10`
  - Signer: Operations public key, weight `2`
  
  Sign with Freighter (issuer key). This allows:
  - Ops key (weight=2) → `set_authorized` (medium=2) ✅
  - Only issuer (weight=10) → mint/clawback/set_admin (high=10) 🔒
  
- [ ] **Lock issuer account AFTER initial token minting**
  ```bash
  # WARNING: This is IRREVERSIBLE! Only do after all tokens are minted.
  npm run multisig:setup -- -a issuer --lock
  ```
  This sets `masterWeight: 0` preventing any further minting.

- [x] **Remove secret keys from production .env** — `.env.production` has zero Stellar secret keys. Only public keys + `OPERATIONS_SECRET_KEY` present (Operations key is via Docker Secrets, not `.env`).
  - Issuer/Treasury/Distributor transactions require Ledger/Freighter signatures

### Emergency Contacts (CONTINGENCY_RUNBOOK.md)
- [ ] **Fill in emergency contact table** in `CONTINGENCY_RUNBOOK.md` — all roles (Issuer signer 1/2/3, Contract admin, Contract seller, Ops on-call) are blank. Without this, incident response is ad-hoc.

### Kill Switch
- [ ] **`ENABLE_SOROBAN_SALE`**: Currently `=true` in `.env.production`. Confirm this is intentional before mainnet launch. Set to `false` to block all investments if needed (API returns 503).

## ✅ Post-Launch Verification

```bash
# Verify account configuration on Stellar Explorer
# https://stellarchain.io/accounts/GXXXX (your issuer public key)
# Should show: 
#   - Flags: auth_required, auth_revocable, auth_clawback_enabled
#   - Master Weight: 0 (if locked)
#   - Signers: Your Ledger public keys
```

### Verify stellar.toml is live and shows mainnet passphrase
```bash
curl -s https://radox.net/.well-known/stellar.toml | head -20
# Should show:
#   NETWORK_PASSPHRASE="Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015"
#   ACCOUNTS, [[CURRENCIES]] with IPFS links
```

### Container health
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.production ps
# All 5 containers: Up (healthy)
```

### API endpoint
```bash
curl https://api.radox.net/health
# → {"status":"ok"}
```
